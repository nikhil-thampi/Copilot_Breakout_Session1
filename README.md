# Copilot Breakout  Session 1

## Welcome to the world of GitHub Copilot ðŸ™‚

Use the C++ files in the repo for the exercises. Complete the exercises in the sequential order.

Hint - 
- Run the exercises on your IDE and if you encounter any compilation errors ask copilot about the errors in terminal
- @terminal #terminalSelection fix or @terminal #terminalSelection explain (if you would like to know more about the
    error) either of the prompts should get you details and a fix if not ask copilot by expanding more on the prompt.

### Exercise 1
1. Generate documentation for the exercise1.cpp without using GitHub Copilot chat (Hint - Use GitHub Copilot code completion options).

### Exercise 2
1. Select exercise2.cpp and use GitHub Copilot Chat to understand the logic of the program. Document the results to the program.
2. Add atleast 2 additional features to the existing C++ program of exercise2.cpp using GitHub Copilot
3. Plan the unit testing of the additional features using GitHub Copilot

### Exercise 3

1. Translate the codebase you have created to C#, generate unit test cases for the code and corresponding documentation

### Exercise 4

3. Create a new C++ workspace, which will call an API from US National Weather Service to get the current temperature for a specific zipcode or city. The code should evaluate the temperate and identify the corresponding climate for that region.
