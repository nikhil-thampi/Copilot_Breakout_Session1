# Copilot_simple_examples

Use the C++ files in the repo for the exercises. Complete the exercises in the sequential order.

## Exercise 1
1. Generate documentation for the exercise1.cpp without using GitHub Copilot chat.

## Exercise 2
1. Select exercise2.cpp and use GitHub Copilot Chat to understand the logic of the program. Document the results to the program.
2. Add atleast 2 additional features to the existing C++ program of exercise2.cpp using GitHub Copilot
3. Plan the unit testing of the additional features using GitHub Copilot

### Exercise 3

1. Translate the codebase you have created to C#, generate unit test cases for the code and corresponding documentation
2. Create a new C++ workspace, which will call an API from US Weather Monitoring system at regular intervals. The code should evaluate the temperate and identify the corresponding climate
